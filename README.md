### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I can clearly see that the labs will serve as the fundamental building blocks for our project. Specifically, I believe the generatecard feature is crucial. Since I'm new to JS, I wouldn't be able to accomplish this without assistance from others.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have been delighted to implement a hover feature. Furthermore, I would have made some changes to the format of the button and clear functionalities.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Things that went well were the amount of learning, I felt that this week I learned so much. Things that didnt go to plan was the imperntiom, I understood the logic however I am new to JS and dont know all the sytax yet. One of my peer had a feature which search as they typed I though this was cool

### Open-source libraries used
